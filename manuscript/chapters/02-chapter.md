## Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina

## 3:42 a.m. local time {#-sarajevo-1}

Aida Ramić shot up from her sleep as her laptop screen exploded.

Not literally. But the streams of data racing across her monitor could just as easily have been fire. Hundreds of
network anomalies, communication spikes, encrypted signals - all at the same time, all without explanation.

"Šta se dešava?" she mumbled, rubbing her eyes. Her fingers flew over the keyboard, typing commands that she had
in her sleep. Aida was one of the best hackers in Eastern Europe, even if no one was officially allowed to know that.

The data made no sense. Satellite feeds from around the world showed the same pattern: sudden spikes in
spikes in activity at 3:00 a.m. local time. London, New York, Tokyo, Sydney. As if the whole world had been holding its breath
at the same time.

Then the live streams began.

Aida opened a dozen windows at the same time. News feeds, social media, private surveillance cameras that she had
had long since hacked. What she saw made her blood run cold.

People on the streets. But they were moving... wrong.

In Manchester, a woman trotted down the high street in a nightgown, a kitchen knife in her hand. In Seoul, a man left his
a man left his apartment and threw Molotov cocktails into his neighbors' windows. In Rio, a whole family systematically
family systematically smashed the cars in their street.

All with the same expressionless face. All with the same blank stare.

"Nah, nah, nah..." Aida typed feverishly, searching for a common denominator, an explanation. A computer virus?
Mass hypnosis? Chemical weapons?

Then she heard a knock on her door.

Aida lived alone in a tiny apartment on the fourth floor of a building that had seen its best days before the war.
had seen its best days before the war. No one visited her at this time of year. No one visited her at all.

The knocking came again. Rhythmically. Patiently. Persistently.

She crept to the door and peeked through the peephole. Her neighbor, Mr. Martinović, was standing in the hallway. A retired teacher,
who usually greeted politely and had his own worries.

But his face...

It was the same expressionless stare as the people in the videos.

"Aida," he said in a voice that was his and yet not his. "Open the door. We need to talk."

Aida backed away from the spy. Her laptop beeped a warning. New data poured in - reports of massacres in hospitals
hospitals, pilots crashing their planes, soldiers shooting at their own comrades.

Everywhere in the world. At the same time.

"Aida." Martinović's voice was closer now. As if he were standing right outside the door. "You can't stay in there forever.
forever. We know you're there."

*We?*

Aida ran to her window and looked out. There were people in the street. Dozens of them. They were all looking
up to her window. All with the same blank expression.

Her cell phone rang. An unknown number.

"Hello?" she whispered.

"Aida Ramić," said a voice she didn't recognize. But the accent... American? "Listen and don't ask
no questions. Take your laptop and leave the building. Now."

"Who is that? How did you-"

"The roof. There's a fire escape at the back. Move along."

The line was dead.

## Los Angeles, USA {#-los-angeles-1}

## 6:58 a.m. local time

Officer Daryl Mensah stared at his partner's body, trying to understand why his hand wouldn't stop shaking.
shaking.

Jenny Martinez lay in a pool of blood in front of the 24-hour gas station, which they actually just wanted to stop for a routine check.
wanted to stop. Three gunshot wounds to the chest. Precise. Professional.

Daryl had fired.

But Jenny had shot first. At the child.

"Dispatch, we need... we need everything here," he spoke into the radio, his voice raspy. "Officer down. Civilian
down. Suspect..." He faltered. "Suspect neutralized."

How did you explain that the suspect was your own partner?

It had started at 3 o'clock in the morning. An emergency call - domestic violence in apartment 12B. Standard procedure. They had
driven there, knocked on the door. Mrs. Chen, a neurologist Daryl had encountered before during a traffic stop,
had called for help.

But when she opened the door, Jenny was just... freaked out.

"You see it too, don't you?" Jenny had whispered, pointing her gun at Mrs. Chen. "The thing in her head. It's
It's moving."

"Jenny, drop the gun!"

"They're all infected, Daryl. Can't you see it?" Jenny's eyes were dilated, her pupils strangely small. "They
have something in them. Something hungry."

Mrs. Chen had tried to explain that she was all right, that she had just had a bad dream. But Jenny didn't listen.
not listen. She took aim.

And then she pulled the trigger.

Daryl had had no choice.

Now he knelt beside Mrs. Chen, who was wounded but alive. "It's okay," he murmured as he applied pressure to the
the bullet wound on her shoulder. "You'll be fine."

"Officer," Mrs. Chen reached for his arm, her eyes wide and clear. "Your partner... she wasn't herself,
wasn't she?"

Daryl froze. "What do you mean?"

"The eyes. Did you see her eyes? The flickering?"

He had seen it. Jenny's eyes had pulsed as if there was a faint light behind them.

"It's not her fault," Mrs. Chen whispered. "She wasn't herself anymore. None of them are."

"Who are you talking about?"

Mrs. Chen gestured weakly towards the window. Daryl followed her gaze and saw people standing in the street. Dozens of
of them. All of them were looking up at the apartment.

All with the same flickering light in their eyes.

Daryl's radio crackled: "All units, all units. We have multiple incidents throughout the city.
Repeat: multiple incidents. Officers are attacking civilians. Civilians attacking officers. All available
units..."

The dispatcher's voice broke off. Then, after a moment of silence: "Help. Someone... they're here. They're all
here and they're staring at me and I can't... I can't..."

Silence.

Daryl reached for his gun, checked the magazine. Full load. But how many shots would he need? And at
who would he shoot?

Mrs. Chen tugged at his sleeve. "The lights," she gasped, "have you seen the golden lights?"

He had seen them. Glowing dots in the sky that moved like living stars.

"What are they?"

"I don't know," Mrs. Chen replied. "But I think... I think they're here to help."

## Brno, Czech Republic {#-brno-1}

## 12:34 p.m. local time

Miriam Košová hid thirteen children in the school library and prayed that the barricade in front of the door would hold.

She heard footsteps in the corridor outside. Slowly. Methodically. The footsteps of her colleagues, school by school,
searching classroom by classroom.

It had started during the second lesson. Miriam was teaching history - the Velvet Revolution,
Hope and Change - when Mr. Novák, the math teacher, stormed into the classroom.

Without a word, he had grabbed Anna, a ten-year-old girl in the front row, and thrown her against the wall.

"Mr. Novák!" Miriam had jumped up. "What are you doing?"

He had looked at her with eyes that were not his. Eyes that flickered like faulty light bulbs. Then he had
smiled.

"Lessons," he had said. "I teach them what pain means."

Miriam had pressed the emergency button, but there had been no emergency as planned. Instead, more teachers had
had turned up. All with the same flickering gaze. All with the same hungry smiles.

She had gathered as many children as she could and ran to the library. The safest place she knew.
Books as a barricade, knowledge as protection.

But it wouldn't be enough.

"Mrs. Košová," whispered Tomáš, an eight-year-old boy with big eyes. "Why have the teachers become so angry?"

Miriam squatted down next to him. How do you explain to a child that the world had gone mad? That the people
they trusted had become monsters?

"Sometimes," she said quietly, "people are sick. But not in their bodies. In their..." she tapped her forehead.
forehead, "in here."

"Can they get better?"

Miriam looked at the window. She saw strange lights dancing in the sky. Golden dots that moved in patterns that almost looked
that almost looked like speech.

"I think so," she said, hoping she was right.

The footsteps outside the door stopped.

"Miriam," called a familiar voice. Mrs. Dvořáková, the principal. "We know you're in there. With the
children."

Miriam told the children to be quiet.

"You can't protect them forever," the voice continued. "They have to learn. We all have to learn what we
really are."

A knock on the door. Then a scratching sound. As if fingernails were scraping over wood.

"People are so fragile," whispered the principal. "So full of unnecessary emotions. Love. Hope.
Compassion. We can help them let it all go."

Miriam hugged the children closer to her. Thirteen little lives entrusted to her. Thirteen reasons not to
to give up.

The scratching became louder.

And then, suddenly, it fell silent.

"What...?" The principal's voice sounded confused. "No. That's not possible."

Miriam heard quick footsteps. Footsteps running away.

She crept to the window and looked out. The golden lights in the sky had become brighter. And all around the
schoolyard - the teachers, the staff - stood staring around in confusion, as if they had just woken up from a dream.
awakening from a dream.

"Mrs. Košová?" Tomáš tugged at her sleeve. "Are the bad teachers good again now?"

Miriam watched as Mr. Novák cupped his hands over his face and began to cry. How the principal
sank to her knees and began to scream.

"I think," she said slowly, "someone is helping them."

But who? And how long would it take?

And what was the price they all had to pay?

The golden lights pulsed brightly for once, and Miriam had the feeling that everything was about to change.

She just didn't know whether it was for the better or for the worse.
