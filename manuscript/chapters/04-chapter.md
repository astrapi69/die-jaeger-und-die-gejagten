## Griffith Observatory, Los Angeles

## 8:42 a.m. local time

The golden light hovered in front of Sarah Chen and waited for her answer.

"Show us," she finally said. "Show us everything."

*Be ready*, warned the voice of Anari. *The truth will be hard to bear.

The light exploded.

Not physically - but in their minds, the universe unfolded like a cosmic flower. Sarah saw stars she didn't
worlds that bathed in alien suns, civilizations that had evolved over millennia.

And the same pattern everywhere: harmony, progress, peace.

Then came the Vak'tar.

Sarah saw it from the victims' perspective. Tiny, mechanical parasites that came out of nowhere. How they bored into
brains, erasing personalities, turning peaceful inhabitants into sadistic killers.

*Twenty-three worlds*, whispered the Anari voice. *Twenty-three civilizations. All destroyed before we arrived in time.
arrived in time.

Daryl Mensah clasped his hands over his eyes. "Jesus Christ. All these people..."

*Not people. But just as valuable. Just as... innocent.

The visions changed. Now they saw the Anari - beings of light of breathtaking beauty and complexity. They
moved among the stars like living thoughts, healing worlds, bringing hope.

But always too late. Always one step behind the Vak'tar.

*Until now*, said the voice, and a new image formed. The earth, seen from far above. But not the earth as
as it was - the earth as it could be.

Crystal clear oceans. Cities that merged with nature. People who traveled between the stars. No wars.
No poverty. No diseases.

"That... That's impossible," Aida whispered, her fingers trembling over the keyboard of her laptop.

*Not impossible. Inevitable. If you survive.

Father Martinez stepped forward. "And if we don't survive?"

The vision darkened. They saw the earth as a dead rock, all the oceans boiled away, all the forests burnt up. Seven
billion corpses crumbling to dust.

*The Vak'tar feed on pain,* the Anari explained. *But when the pain stops, when they're all dead...
they move on. Nothing is left behind.

Miriam Košová had tears in her eyes. "Why are you telling us this? Why are you showing us... the end?"

*Because you have the right to know. And because you can still vote.

"Vote?" Sarah frowned. "Between what?"

The golden light pulsed, and suddenly they were no longer standing in the observatory parking lot. They were standing...
somewhere else.

A room of pure light, endless and warm. Other figures moved in the distance - more Anari, Sarah realized.
Hundreds of them.

*Welcome to our council*, said a new voice, deeper and older than the first. *I am Elyon, spokesman for the Anari.
We have long debated your fate.

"Our destiny?" Daryl instinctively reached for his gun, but found only light.

*The Vak'tar main fleet will reach your system in 47 hours and 23 minutes. Two thousand ships. Millions of
parasites. Enough to take over every human on your planet in a matter of hours.

Aida laughed bitterly. "So we're screwed."

*Normally... Yes. But not this time.

Elyon floated closer, and Sarah saw that the being of light was not just energy. She recognized structures, almost like a
face, but infinitely more complex.

*For the first time, we have reached them before the completion of their mission. For the first time, we can intervene before
a world dies. But...*

"But?" Father Martinez already suspected the answer.

*But we can't fight for you. That is against our fundamental laws. We can only... equip you*.

"With what?" asked Sarah.

Elyon spread out what could have been arms, and light space exploded in color. Technologies that Sarah
could not even theoretically understand. Weapons that rearranged matter. Healing devices that could reverse death itself.
could reverse death itself. Spaceships that traveled between dimensions.

*Ten thousand years of Anari science. Everything we know. All that we are. We give it to you.

"Why?" Miriam sounded confused. "Why would you do so much for strangers?"

*Because you are not strangers. And because we have a debt to pay.

The visions changed again. This time they saw a different world - a blue world with two moons and purple oceans.
oceans.

*That was Kythara. Our home. Four thousand years ago.

They saw a civilization of breathtaking beauty. Beings of light who lived in harmony, created art, explored the
exploring the secrets of the universe.

Then came the Vak'tar.

*We were young. Naive. We believed that all beings were basically good. When the parasites came, we welcomed them as guests.
guests*.

Sarah saw the massacre. Millions of Anari, being destroyed by beings who had once been her own siblings.
had once been her own siblings.

*The Vak'tar were originally Anari,* Elyon explained, his voice carrying infinite sorrow. *A branch of our
species that... other paths. Who believed that pain was the key to evolution.

"Your own people have betrayed you," whispered Father Martinez.

*And almost destroyed. Only a few of us survived. We fled to the stars, vowing to protect others from what we had experienced,
from what we had experienced.

"But it's not working," Daryl realized. "They're always too fast for you."

*Goods. Until now.

Elyon floated over to Sarah. *You, Dr. Chen, were the first to successfully resist a Vak'tar. Not by
by chance, but by force of will. You showed us that humans are... are different.

"Different how?"

*More resilient. More unpredictable. The Vak'tar calculate with logic and fear. But humans... Humans have
something they don't understand.

"What?" asked Aida.

*Hope against all reason. Love despite pain. The willingness to fight, even when the fight seems hopeless.
*

Miriam smiled through her tears. "You're talking about humanity."

*Yes. And that is your greatest weapon.

The light space changed again. Now they were standing in what looked like a laboratory - but a laboratory made of
crystalline light in which thoughts took shape.

*We will give you everything*, said Elyon. *Technology, knowledge, power. But it will come at a price.

"Of course," Daryl muttered, "There always is."

*The price is change. You cannot use Anari technology and remain the same as you were. Your
brains must be expanded. Your bodies strengthened. Your souls... touched.*

Sarah felt a cold fear in her chest. "They're talking about experiments. On us."

*Not experiments. Evolution. Accelerated, but voluntary.

Father Martinez shook his head. "How do we know you're not manipulating us just like the parasites?"

*Because we give you the choice.

Suddenly they were back in the observatory parking lot. The sun was shining, birds were chirping, normal sounds
of a normal world. As if the vision had only been a dream.

But the golden lights were still hovering above them.

*You have six hours*, said Elyon's voice. *Then we must begin, or it will be too late. Each of you must
decide for yourselves.

Sarah looked at the faces of her new allies. Five people from different worlds, different cultures,
different belief systems. United only by what they had survived.

"What happens if we say no?" she asked.

*Then you fight as you are. And die as you are. With honor, but without hope.

"And if we say yes?"

*Then people become something new. Something that can walk among the stars. Something that could not only survive this battle
but could change the universe.

Aida typed nervously on her laptop. "I'm getting new data," she said quietly. "The Vak'tar fleet... they've increased their
increased their speed."

"How much time do we have left?" asked Daryl.

"Thirty-six hours. Maybe less."

Silence fell over the group.

Father Martinez was the first to speak: "I have dedicated my whole life to the belief that there is something greater than us.
than us. Something that will guide us if we let it." He looked up at the golden lights, "Maybe that's my answer.
my answer."

Miriam nodded. "I think of the children I've tried to protect. Of all the children in the world. If there's a
chance..."

"I'm a soldier," Daryl said simply. "Soldiers fight. No matter what weapons."

Aida closed her laptop. "I've spent my whole life overcoming borders. Firewall after firewall.
Maybe this is just the ultimate frontier."

All eyes turned to Sarah.

She thought of the voice in her head, the loss of control, the fear. Then she thought of Mrs. Patterson,
of all the people who had died tonight. Of all the people who would still die.

"I'm a neurologist," she finally said. "I study the brain, consciousness, what makes us human.
If we have a chance to preserve that - not just for ourselves, but for everyone - then we have to take it."

She looked up at the Anari, "We're ready."

*Then let us begin*, said Elyon. *Let us show you what humans can become when they open themselves to the stars.
*

The golden light became brighter and brighter until it filled everything.

And Sarah Chen, a neurologist from San Francisco, felt her mind opening up and touching things she had never thought possible.
possible.

The war for the earth had begun.

But maybe - just maybe - people would not end up as victims this time.

But as something completely new.
