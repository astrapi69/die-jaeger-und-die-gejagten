## Orbit of Mars {#-orbit-of-mars}

## 11:43 Earth Time

Sarah Chen raced toward the first alien spaceship she had ever seen—fifty thousand kilometers per hour—and wondered if
she had lost her mind.

The Vak'tar ship appeared as a black thorn against the red of Mars. Angular, organic, like a colossal insect made of
living metal. It moved sluggishly through space, its sensors methodically scanning the solar system.

**They haven't noticed us yet**, Aida signaled from her ship. **Their tech is optimized for conventional spacecraft.
We're flying outside their detection parameters.**

**Good**, Sarah replied. **Element of surprise. Humanity's oldest tactic.**

The weight of her new responsibility pressed on her. Hours ago, she'd been a sleep-deprived neurologist. Now, she was
leading humanity’s first interplanetary combat mission.

**Maintain formation**, she commanded. **Daryl and I will take point. Aida, try hacking their systems. Father Martinez
and Miriam—cover us.**

**Understood**, came four voices in unison.

The Vak'tar ship loomed larger. Sarah now saw the grotesque details—hull openings that resembled mouths, pulsating veins
of dark light coursing through the structure. This wasn’t just a ship. It was a living organism.

**My God**, whispered Father Martinez. **It’s... beautiful.**

**Beautiful and deadly**, Daryl corrected. **Like a cobra.**

Sarah focused her enhanced senses. Up close, she could feel the presence inside the vessel—hundreds of beings. No... not
beings. Parasites. Crawling through the ship like blood through veins.

**It’s full of Vak’tar**, she said. **Brace yourselves.**

Suddenly, the alien ship changed course. It turned toward them like a predator catching the scent of prey.

**They’ve spotted us**, Aida alerted. **Trying to disrupt their communication, but... their systems are organic. Like a
brain.**

One of the ship’s gaping orifices opened—and something emerged. Not a missile. Something alive. A black mass unfurled
into space like ink in water.

**What is that?** Miriam asked, alarmed.

Sarah sensed it before she saw it—millions of tiny lifeforms racing toward them.

**Parasite swarm**, she realized. **They're attempting to breach our ships.**

**Then it’s time they learned—humans aren't so easy to conquer anymore,** Daryl said grimly.

His ship transformed. The liquid light it was made of solidified into what resembled winged steel. Strange weapons
formed along its surface—glowing with the same golden energy as the Anari.

Daryl fired.

The beam wasn’t just energy—it was *intelligent*. Sarah watched it weave through the swarm, targeting and vaporizing
each organism with surgical precision.

The black mass evaporated like smoke.

**Holy shit**, Daryl exclaimed. **That beats every weapon I've ever fired.**

**Focus**, Sarah reminded. **That was only the first wave.**

The Vak'tar ship pulsed violently. Sarah felt something stir inside her mind. A familiar, sinister buzz. A psychic
intrusion.

*Little lights,* a cold voice whispered. *You think you can stop us? We are Legion. We are inevitable.*

**They’re trying to possess us**, Sarah warned. **Raise mental shields!**

The voice only laughed. *You’re still human, deep down. And humans are weak. Afraid. Full of doubt. And pain.*

Visions struck Sarah: Jenny Martinez aiming at a child. Mrs. Delgado with a raised knife. All the people turned into
monsters tonight.

*You see?* the voice hissed. *You are the monsters. We simply reveal the truth.*

Sarah hesitated. Was it right? Was civilization just a thin veil?

Then she heard Father Martinez—audibly, not mentally—his voice calm and firm over the comms:

"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name..."

**What are you doing?** Daryl asked.

**Something deeply human,** Martinez replied. **I’m praying. For all of us.**

And Sarah felt it—a warmth flowing through her mind. Not the cold precision of Anari tech, but something older. Deeper.

Hope.

*Impossible,* the Vak’tar voice faltered.

**No**, Sarah responded with calm certainty. **It’s human. And you’ll never understand it.**

She fired her neural disruptor.

The beam wasn’t golden—it was white. Pure, clean light that sliced through space like a scalpel through flesh.

The Vak’tar ship screamed—not in sound, but in a vibration that shook her bones. A howl of millions of tormented souls.

**They’re not just parasites**, Aida gasped. **The ship… it’s made from assimilated lifeforms. Conquered species turned
into tech.**

Sarah saw it too. The ship’s “organic” parts weren’t grown. They were once *living beings*. Enslaved. Transformed into
machinery.

**My God**, Miriam whispered. **They're prisoners.**

Martinez’s voice rose: “…and deliver us from evil…”

Sarah’s disruptor burrowed deeper. The screaming faded. In its place: gratitude. Relief. Peace.

She was freeing them.

**That’s it**, she declared. **We’re not killing them. We’re setting them free.**

The others understood. Four beams hit the Vak’tar ship from all sides—Daryl’s adaptive cannons, Aida’s quantum rays,
Martinez’s healing energy, Miriam’s empathic pulses.

The ship unraveled—not destructively, but like a flower shedding its petals. Millions of light-points streamed from its
hull. Liberated souls. Finally at rest.

The true Vak’tar—the parasites—were exposed. Small, fragile. Shivering in the vacuum of space.

**They’re so... tiny**, Miriam said, almost pitying.

**Tiny and vicious**, Daryl snapped, aiming his weapons.

**Wait**, Sarah said. A thought formed. **Aida, can you capture them? Alive?**

**Why?**

**They hold intel. On their main fleet. On their weaknesses.**

Aida’s ship cast an energy net—catching the swarm without destroying it.

**Captured**, she confirmed. **But they’re still dangerous.**

Sarah looked toward the other two Vak’tar ships approaching. Slower. Cautious. They had witnessed everything.

**Incoming transmission**, Aida said. **Not a language I recognize.**

**Let me try**, said Martinez.

He opened his empathic senses to the alien signal.

**They're… afraid**, he said. **Truly afraid. And... confused.**

**Confused about what?** Sarah asked.

**That we freed their prisoners instead of destroying them. It’s… never happened before.**

A wild idea sparked in Sarah’s mind.

**Send them a message**, she said. **Tell them we’re not enemies. We came to free the prisoners. All of them.**

**Sarah**, Daryl warned. **They’re monsters.**

**No**, she said gently. **The parasites are monsters. The ships—they’re prisoners, too.**

A pause. Then: a response.

Not weapons. A message.

Martinez translated: **They ask… if we can help them too.**

Sarah looked toward Earth—so small, so vulnerable. In seventeen hours, two thousand such ships would arrive. Each
carrying millions of captives and thousands of parasites.

An unwinnable war. Unless...

**Yes**, she signaled. **We can help. All of you.**

**Sarah**, Aida warned. **This is a huge risk.**

**This is hope**, Martinez said. **Something deeply human.**

The enemy ships moved closer—like wild beasts seeing kindness for the first time.

**If this works**, Daryl said, **we’re not just fighting. We’re liberating.**

**And if it doesn’t?** asked Miriam.

Sarah looked at her four companions—reborn, yet still human.

**Then we die as what we are. As people who tried to do the right thing.**

The first freed Vak’tar ship joined their formation. Its organic structure began to glow—not coldly, but warmly.

**It’s transforming**, Aida said in awe. **The freed parts are forming something new.**

**An alliance**, Sarah smiled. **Between humans—and everyone who wants to be free.**

She looked toward the stars, where the main fleet approached.

**Send word to Earth**, she ordered. **Tell them we’re coming home. And we’re not coming alone.**

The war for Earth had just taken a radical turn.
