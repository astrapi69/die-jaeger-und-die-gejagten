## Griffith Observatory, Los Angeles

## 10:17 a.m. local time

Sarah Chen died at 10:17 a.m. on a Tuesday morning.

Not physically. Her heart continued to beat, her lungs breathed, her blood flowed. But the person she had been -
the neurologist, the skeptic, the woman who had believed in the limits of science - that person ceased to exist.
to exist.

The golden light did not simply penetrate them. It *became* them.

Sarah felt her consciousness expanding like a balloon being inflated. But instead of bursting, it simply
simply continued to grow. She saw through her own eyes, but also through the eyes of others. Daryl, who was
screaming in pain. Aida, whose laptop screen suddenly displayed languages that no human had ever written. Father
Martinez, who prayed and cried as his faith was redefined. Miriam, who thought of the children and felt
every memory transformed into crystal clear perfection.

*Don't be afraid*, Elyon's voice whispered, but now it wasn't coming from outside. It came from her own expanded
mind. *You are not dying. You are being born.

Sarah tried to speak, but her voice came out as light. Pulsating, golden light that carried meaning.

**I don't understand**, she lit up.

*You will. Soon.

Her body changed. Not dramatically, not visibly, but fundamentally. Sarah felt new nerve pathways forming
formed, how her brain rewired itself. Her vision expanded beyond the visible spectrum. She
she saw the infrared radiation of the bodies around her, the electromagnetic fields of her thoughts, the subtle
gravitational waves running through the observatory.

And then she heard it.

The universe spoke.

Not in words, but in patterns. Energy signatures from distant stars. Quantum fluctuations that carried messages.
carried. The constant noise of billions of civilizations communicating between galaxies.

Sarah had thought all her life that the earth was silent. Now she realized that she had been deaf.

*That's the first step,* Elyon explained. *Consciousness expansion. You can now hear what the Vak'tar are whispering.

As if on cue, Sarah perceived a new frequency. Colder. Hungrier. Like the buzzing of billions of insects,
approaching a feast.

The Vak'tar fleet.

*They got here early,** Daryl glowed, his new voice full of alarm. **Sixteen hours early**.

Sarah focused her extended senses on the edge of the solar system. There, beyond Pluto, she saw them. Black
Ships that swallowed the light. Thousands of them, like a swarm of deadly viruses hurtling towards a living organism.
organism.

**How much longer?** pulsated Aida.

*Eighteen hours*, Elyon replied. *Maybe less if they increase the speed even more.

Father Martinez lit up with divine fury: **Then we don't have enough time for gentle transformations.

*No. We have to move on to the second phase.

**Second phase?** Sarah felt fear in her expanded consciousness.

*Physical augmentation. Combat readiness. It will be... painful*.

The golden light around her intensified. Sarah felt something fundamental begin to work in her cells.
began to work. Her DNA was being rewritten, not from the outside, but from the inside. Her body was optimizing itself.

The pain came like a wave.

Sarah fell to her knees, but her knees did not hit the ground. She floated, carried by forces she did not understand.
understood. Around her, her companions screamed, but their screams were beams of light dancing through the air.

Her muscles thickened, became denser, stronger. Her bones hardened into a substance that was stronger
than steel, but lighter than carbon. Her heart beat slower but more powerfully, pumping a blood infused with nanobots
Anari technology that worked on a cellular level.

*Your reflexes*, Elyon explained as Sarah felt her nervous system speed up, *are now a hundred times
faster than a normal human. You can dodge a bullet after it's been fired.

**And that's just the beginning**, added a new voice - Aida, but her mental voice now sounded like a supercomputer.
supercomputer. **I can tap into any frequency, hack any database, take over any system. It's... incredible.
**

Sarah looked over at her. Aida still looked the same on the outside - slim, pale, with short black hair. But
her eyes... her eyes glowed slightly, and Sarah could see the streams of data flowing through them.

Daryl stood up and tested his new skills. He jumped - and landed on the roof of the observatory, twelve meters
meters above them. Then he jumped down again, landing as softly as a feather.

**Holy shit**, he lit up. **This is better than any drug**.

Father Martinez knelt quietly, his eyes closed. But Sarah could see the energy around him - a calm, powerful
calm, powerful aura that lay over everyone else like a protective shield.

**I can feel your pain**, he glowed softly. **And they heal**.

Miriam glowed with maternal warmth: **I can sense every living thing within a five kilometer radius.
Every child, every survivor. You are not alone.

*Very good,* said Elyon. *But that's just the basic equipment. You'll need weapons for the real fight.

The air shimmered, and something materialized in front of each of them.

In front of Sarah: A device that looked like a cross between a medical scanner and a weapon. **Neuronal
Disruptor**, Elyon explained. **It can remove Vak'tar parasites from a host without killing the host.

In front of Daryl: Something that looked like liquid metal, but could be molded into any weapon he imagined. *
*Adaptive combat equipment. It reacts to your thoughts.

In front of Aida: A small device, no bigger than a smartphone, but it hummed with the power of a supercomputer. *
*Quantum network interface. You can now communicate with any system in the universe.

In front of Father Martinez: A kind of staff that looked like crystallized light. **Healer Focus. You can bring back life
bring back life where death is not yet final.

In front of Miriam: An amulet that looked like a small star. **Empathy Amplifier. You can influence the emotions of living beings
of living beings within a radius of hundreds of kilometers.

Sarah picked up her device. It felt warm, alive. As she touched it, information flooded into her mind.
mind. She immediately understood how it worked, how she could use it.

**This is incredible**, she glowed. **But... Are we still human?

*You are more than human*, Elyon replied. *But you have not lost your humanity. That is the difference
difference between evolution and conquest.

Suddenly an alarm flashed through her expanded consciousness.

Aida glowed in panic: **The Vak'tar Vanguard! They've reached the solar system!

Sarah focused her new senses and saw them. Three black ships, small but deadly, orbiting the outer planets.
orbiting the outer planets.

**Scouts**, Elyon confirmed. **They are scanning your defenses**.

**What defenses?** Daryl glared sarcastically.

*You.

Sarah stood up and felt the new strength in her muscles, the new clarity in her mind. "Then we should show them
show them that the earth is no longer defenceless."

**How?** asked Miriam.

Sarah smiled - and her smile lit up. "By paying them a visit."

*That*, Elyon said with something that could have been pride, *sounds very... human.

## 15 minutes later

Sarah Chen stood in what had once been the parking lot of Griffith Observatory. Now it was a landing pad for
five objects that looked like liquid light.

**Anari ships**, Elyon explained. **They will respond to your thoughts**.

Sarah touched the nearest one. It was warm, almost alive. When she looked inside, it opened like a flower.

The interior was not what she had expected. No seats, no controls in the conventional sense. Just a room of
of gently pulsating light.

She climbed aboard and immediately felt the ship connect with her consciousness. She was no longer Sarah Chen
in a spaceship. She was the spaceship. Every sensor was her skin, every weapon her hand, every drive her
muscles.

**Ready?** Daryl lit up from his own ship.

**Ready**, the other four replied simultaneously.

Sarah thought "up", and the ship responded. Not like a machine that executes a command, but like a
body part that moves. It shot upwards, through the atmosphere, out into the blackness of space.

Her four companions followed, five points of light stretching towards the stars.

**My God**, Father Martinez glowed. **Is that...?**

**The earth**, Miriam finished reverently.

She looked so small from up here. So vulnerable. A blue marble floating in the blackness, unprotected against
the hordes that approached.

Sarah focused her sensors on the Vak'tar scouts. Three ships orbiting Mars. They looked like
black insects, angular and evil.

**Plan?** asked Aida.

Sarah felt her new instincts awaken. Combat knowledge that the Anari had implanted in her consciousness.

"We show them that this world has teeth," she said aloud.

She thought "attack", and her ship shot forward like a golden flash.

The war for the earth had begun.

But this time the people fought back.
