## 📖 About the Book

A mysterious alien species, the **Vak'tar**, takes control of humanity through psychic parasites. At the same time,
golden lights appear in the sky – messengers of the **Anari**, an ancient civilization of light.

Five survivors – a neurologist, a cop, a hacker, a priest, and a teacher – unite. But the key to salvation lies not in
violence, but in **transformation**: physical, mental, and spiritual.

In the end, it is not only a fight for Earth — but for the freedom of an entire galaxy.
