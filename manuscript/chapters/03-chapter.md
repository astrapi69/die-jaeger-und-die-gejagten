Father Ignacio Martinez knelt between the bodies of sixteen parishioners and prayed to a God who seemed very far away tonight.
seemed very far away tonight.

They had come to the church when the violence began. Seekers, the lost, families with children - all asking for
protection from the madness that had gripped the streets. Ignacio had opened the doors, as he always did.

He hadn't known that some of them were already... were already changed.

Mrs. Delgado had been the first. A 67-year-old grandmother who sat in the front row every Sunday and baked cookies for the church coffee.
baking cookies for the church coffee. She had pulled a knife out of her handbag and attacked the family next to her.
at the family next to her.

Then it became a chain reaction.

Ignacio had tried to help, had tried to understand. But when he looked into Mrs. Delgado's eyes - the
flickering, inhuman eyes - he had known that this was no longer the woman he had baptized, married and buried.
buried.

"Padre," croaked a weak voice.

Ignacio turned around. Miguel Santos, a fourteen-year-old boy, was lying behind the altar. Three deep scratches ran across his chest
across his chest, but he was still breathing.

"Miguel." Ignacio hurried to him. "Don't be afraid. You're safe."

"No," the boy whispered. "No one is safe. They... they're in our heads, Padre. I can hear them.
Whispering."

Ignacio's blood froze. "What are they whispering?"

"That... that God is dead. That there is only us left. And that we all have to learn what real power means."

Miguel grabbed Ignacio's wrist. His eyes flickered.

"I'm sorry, Padre."

The boy moved faster than a wounded man should. The knife - Mrs. Delgado's knife - flashed.

Ignacio rolled away, the knife missing his neck by centimeters. Miguel got to his feet, moving jerkily
like a broken marionette.

"Miguel, it's not you!" Ignacio backed away. "Fight it!"

"Fight?" Miguel laughed, but it wasn't his voice. "Why should he fight? We give him strength. Clarity.
Purpose."

"You're giving him death."

"We give him evolution."

Miguel jumped forward. Ignacio reached for the heavy silver cross on the altar and swung it. It hit the boy on the
on the temple and he fell to the ground.

For a moment, Miguel's eyes were normal again. Frightened. Confused.

"Padre? What... what happened? Why does everything hurt so much?"

Then his eyes flickered again and Miguel grinned.

"You can't kill us all, priest. There are already too many of us."

Ignacio heard footsteps outside the church. Many footsteps.

He ran to the window and looked out. Hundreds of people were streaming towards the church. All with the same
flickering gaze. All with the same hungry smile.

"My God," he whispered.

"God," said Miguel, who was on his feet again, "is not here."

Suddenly, light exploded through the church windows. Not the warm light of the stained glass windows, but something colder,
purer. A golden light that filled the entire church.

Miguel cried out and fell to the ground again. His eyes stopped flickering.

"Padre?" His voice was again that of a frightened boy. "I remember everything. Oh God, what have I
done?"

Ignacio helped him to his feet. "It wasn't you, son."

Outside, they heard confusion. Cries of disorientation, not anger.

Ignacio carefully opened the church door. The people, who had seemed like a mob only minutes ago, were now standing around
around in confusion. Many were crying. Others stared at their own hands as if they were seeing them for the first time.

In the sky, the golden lights danced in patterns that almost looked like... language.

"What are they?" whispered Miguel.

"I don't know," Ignacio replied. "But I think they're here to help."

One of the lights hovered closer. It pulsed, and Ignacio heard... not heard, but *understood* a voice:

*Peace be with you, guardian of the faith. We have come to right the wrongs.

## 5:23 a.m. local time

Aida Ramić balanced on the narrow windowsill on the sixth floor and wondered if hacking skills would help her fall.
would help.

The fire escape that the mysterious caller had mentioned had been rusted for ten years. Three rungs were missing, and
and the rest looked as if it would collapse at the first touch.

The possessed neighbors were still standing below her. They no longer looked up at her window - they just waited.
simply. Patiently. Like spiders in a web.

Her laptop was stowed in a waterproof backpack. Twenty kilos of the best hacker hardware on her back while she
trying not to fall.

*Genius, Aida*, she thought. *You don't die from aliens, you die from falling*.

Her cell phone vibrated. A text message from the unknown number:

*Northwest corner. White van. Moving now.

Aida looked in that direction. Sure enough - a white van with the engine running. At the wheel was a woman with short
gray hair.

*Who the hell...*

No time for questions. The people below had started to move. All at the same time, all in the direction of the
entrance to the building.

Aida took a deep breath and jumped.

The fire escape groaned, but held. Rung by rung, it worked its way down, each movement a small miracle of not dying.
of not dying.

The last rung broke three meters above the ground.

She fell, landing hard on the asphalt. Pain shot through her wrist, but nothing was broken.

"Here!" The woman in the van waved her over.

Aida ran. Behind her, she heard the mechanical footsteps of the possessed running around the building.

She jumped into the van and the woman accelerated.

"Who are you?" gasped Aida.

"Dr. Sarah Chen," the woman replied as she raced through the empty streets. "Neurologist from the USA. And you are
Aida Ramić, hacker and one of the few people on this planet who could understand what's happening."

"How do you know-"

"I'll explain that later. Can you get your computers up and running here?" Sarah pointed to a row of laptops in the back seat.
the back seat.

Aida took a closer look. Military hardware, encryption software, satellite uplinks. "Who gave you this?"

"The same people who gave me your address." Sarah took a sharp right. "The golden lights."

As if she had given a cue, the sky above them lit up. The lights formed themselves into patterns, into
symbols, almost like...

"Coordinates," Aida whispered. "They're showing us coordinates."

"Where to?"

Aida typed feverishly on one of the laptops. The symbols translated into numbers, the numbers into positions. "Los
Angeles. A parking lot near... a police station?"

Sarah smiled grimly. "Then we'll meet a policeman there."

## Los Angeles, USA {#-los-angeles-2}

## 7:15 a.m. local time

Daryl Mensah sat in his patrol car and stared at the radio, which had been transmitting nothing but silence for an hour.

Mrs. Chen had been taken to a hospital - one of the few that was still functioning. Most of the medical
facilities were... compromised. Doctors who killed their patients. Nurses who injected poison into the
IV lines.

The world had gone mad.

Daryl had tried to drive back to the station, but the access road was blocked. Not by barricades - by corpses.
His colleagues had killed each other.

Now he parked in an empty parking lot and wondered what a policeman does when there are no more police.

His radio suddenly crackled to life:

"Officer Mensah? This is Dr. Sarah Chen. Can you hear me?"

Daryl reached for the microphone. "Dr. Chen? I thought you were in the hospital."

"I was. But the golden lights... they showed me where you are. Can you come to the Griffith Observatory?"

"The lights showed you what?"

"It's difficult to explain. But I don't think we're the only survivors. And I think someone is trying
to help us."

Daryl looked up at the sky. The golden lights hovered there, brighter now in the morning light. They moved in
patterns that almost looked like...

"Navigation," he muttered.

"Exactly. Officer, we don't have much time. Whatever these things are in people, they're organizing themselves. And
the lights... I think they're here to stop them."

Daryl started the engine. "On my way."

As he drove through the deserted streets, he saw them everywhere. People wandering around disoriented. No more
flickering eyes, but no clarity either. As if they were caught between two states.

The radio crackled again: "Daryl? This is Father Martinez. I'm on my way to the Observatory too. Sarah told me
explained... well, as best she could."

A new voice spoke up: "This is Miriam Košová. I'm from Brno. The children are safe, but I
I think I have to come with you."

"And I am Aida," a younger voice with an Eastern European accent. "I have data. Lots of data. And I think I
know what these parasites want."

Daryl shook his head. Six hours ago he had been a normal cop. Now he was part of an international
conspiracy against alien parasites.

"So," he said into the microphone, "let's get together and save the world?"

"Something like that," Sarah replied. "But first we need to understand who we're dealing with. Both the bad guys...
As well as the good guys."

Daryl turned into the access road to the observatory. There were already several vehicles in front of him. People were getting out - normal
people with exhausted faces and alert eyes.

And above them hovered one of the golden lights. Bigger than the others. Brighter.

As Daryl got out, he heard a voice in his head. Not invasive like the parasite's. Gentle. Inviting.

*Welcome, warrior. We've been waiting for you.

"Who are you?" he asked loudly.

*We are the ones who come when worlds are in danger. And your world... is in great danger.

Sarah Chen approached him. "They communicate telepathically. But not like the parasites. They don't force themselves on you.
They... ask for permission."

"Permission for what?"

*To show you the truth. To explain to you who attacked you. And why we were too late.

The golden light pulsed, and suddenly Daryl saw images in his head. Other worlds, other species. And everywhere
the same pattern: parasitic invasions, followed by rescue. But not always in time.

*The Vak'tar are criminals,* the voice explained. *Outcasts of our galactic community. We have been hunting them for
centuries. But they've... smart.

"And who are you?" asked Aida, holding a laptop in her hands.

*We are the Anari. And we owe your species an apology... and make amends.

Father Martinez stepped forward. "Restitution for what?"

*For not stopping them in time. For making so many of you suffer. And for...*

The light became dimmer.

*That this was just the beginning.

Silence fell over the group.

"The beginning?" Miriam asked in a weak voice.

*The Vak'tar you have seen are only scouts. The main army is yet to come.

Daryl looked at the faces of his new allies. Exhaustion, fear, but also determination.

"How much time do we have?" asked Sarah.

*Two days. Maybe three.

"And what can we do against an alien army in two days?"

The golden light pulsed brighter.

*With our help? Everything.
