## San Francisco, USA {#-san-francisco-1}

**4:47 a.m. local time**

Father Ignacio Martinez knelt among the bodies of sixteen parishioners and prayed to a God who, tonight, felt impossibly
far away.

They had come to the church when the violence began — seekers, the lost, families with children — all looking for
shelter from the madness outside. Ignacio had opened the doors, as he always did.

He didn’t know some of them were already... changed.

Mrs. Delgado was the first. A 67-year-old grandmother who sat in the front row every Sunday and baked cookies for coffee
hour. She had pulled a knife from her handbag and lunged at the family next to her.

Then chaos erupted.

Ignacio had tried to help. To understand. But when he looked into Mrs. Delgado’s flickering, inhuman eyes — he knew. She
wasn’t the woman he had once baptized, married, and buried.

“Padre,” croaked a weak voice.

Ignacio turned. Miguel Santos, a fourteen-year-old boy, lay behind the altar, three deep gashes across his chest — but
still breathing.

“Miguel.” Ignacio rushed to him. “Don’t be afraid. You’re safe now.”

“No,” the boy whispered. “No one’s safe. They’re... they’re in our heads, Padre. I can hear them.  
Whispering.”

Ignacio’s blood froze. “What are they saying?”

“That God is dead. That only they remain. And that we all need to learn what real power means.”

Miguel grabbed Ignacio’s wrist. His eyes flickered.

“I’m sorry, Padre.”

The boy moved faster than any injured person should. The knife — Mrs. Delgado’s — flashed.

Ignacio rolled just in time. The blade missed his throat by inches. Miguel stood, twitching like a broken marionette.

“Miguel, this isn’t you!” Ignacio backed away. “Fight it!”

“Fight?” Miguel laughed — but it wasn’t his voice. “Why should he fight? We give him strength.  
Clarity.  
Purpose.”

“You’re giving him death.”

“We’re giving him evolution.”

Miguel lunged. Ignacio grabbed the heavy silver cross from the altar and swung. It struck the boy at the temple — he
crumpled to the floor.

For a moment, Miguel’s eyes were normal. Frightened. Confused.

“Padre? What... what happened? Why does it hurt so much?”

Then the flicker returned — and he grinned.

“You can’t kill us all, priest. There are too many of us already.”

Ignacio heard footsteps outside. Dozens. No — hundreds.

He ran to the window. A crowd surged toward the church. All with flickering eyes. All with that same hungry smile.

“My God,” he whispered.

“God,” said Miguel, now standing again, “isn’t here.”

Suddenly, a golden light exploded through the stained-glass windows. Not warm — cold, clean, radiant. It filled the
entire church.

Miguel screamed and collapsed. The flicker vanished from his eyes.

“Padre?” The boy’s voice returned. “I remember everything. Oh God... what did I do?”

Ignacio helped him up. “It wasn’t you, son.”

Outside, confusion reigned. No rage. Just disorientation.

Ignacio slowly opened the church doors. The once-possessed now stood dazed, weeping, staring at their own hands as if
seeing them for the first time.

Above, golden lights danced across the sky in intricate, almost linguistic patterns.

“What are they?” Miguel asked softly.

“I don’t know,” Ignacio said. “But I think... they’re here to help.”

One of the lights floated closer. It pulsed — and Ignacio didn’t *hear* a voice, he *understood* it:

**Peace be with you, Keeper of Faith. We have come to correct what was broken.**

## Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina {#-sarajevo-2}

**5:23 a.m. local time**

Aida Ramić balanced on the sixth-floor windowsill and wondered if hacker skills helped you survive a fall.

The fire escape the mystery caller had mentioned was rusted beyond belief. Three rungs missing. The rest looked ready to
crumble at the first touch.

Below her, the possessed neighbors still waited. They weren’t looking up anymore — they were just… waiting. Patient.
Like spiders at the center of a web.

Her laptop was packed in a waterproof backpack. Twenty kilos of top-tier hacking gear strapped to her back, and all she
had to do was not die falling off a building.

*Brilliant, Aida*, she thought. *You’re not going to die by alien parasite — you’ll die from gravity.*

Her phone buzzed. A new text from the unknown number:

**Northwest corner. White van. Move now.**

She looked. Sure enough — a white van idled with its engine running. At the wheel: a woman with short gray hair.

*Who the hell…*

No time for questions.

The people below began to move — all at once, in eerie synchronization — toward the building’s main entrance.

Aida took a deep breath and jumped.

The fire escape groaned — but held. She descended, rung by rung, each step a miracle of survival.

Three meters from the ground, the last rung gave way.

She fell — hit the asphalt hard. Pain flared through her wrist, but nothing broken.

“Here!” the woman in the van shouted.

Aida sprinted. Behind her, she heard the heavy, mechanical footfalls of the possessed circling the building.

She dove into the van. The woman floored it.

“Who are you?” Aida gasped.

“Dr. Sarah Chen,” the driver said, weaving through empty streets. “Neurologist from the U.S. And you’re Aida Ramić —
hacker, and one of the few people on this planet who might understand what’s happening.”

“How do you even—”

“I’ll explain later. Can you boot your systems in here?” Sarah gestured to a cluster of laptops in the back seat.

Aida turned to look: military-grade machines, encrypted software, satellite uplinks.

“Where did you get this?”

“The same people who gave me your address,” Sarah replied. “The golden lights.”

As if on cue, the sky above lit up. Lights shimmered into complex shapes — symbols that pulsed like code.

“Coordinates,” Aida whispered. “They’re sending us coordinates.”

“To where?”

She typed furiously. The symbols translated into numbers. The numbers became GPS data.

“Los Angeles. A parking lot… near a police station?”

Sarah smirked. “Then we’re about to meet a cop.”

## Los Angeles, USA {#-los-angeles-2}

**7:15 a.m. local time**

Officer Daryl Mensah sat in his patrol car, staring at a radio that had transmitted nothing but static for an hour.

Mrs. Chen had been taken to one of the few still-functioning hospitals. Most medical centers were… compromised. Doctors
killing patients. Nurses injecting poison into IVs.

The world had gone insane.

He’d tried returning to the station, but the access road was blocked. Not by barricades — by bodies.

His fellow officers had slaughtered each other.

Now he sat in an empty parking lot, wondering what a cop does when there’s no police force left.

Then his radio crackled:

**“Officer Mensah? This is Dr. Sarah Chen. Can you hear me?”**

Daryl grabbed the mic. “Dr. Chen? I thought you were in the hospital.”

“I was. But the golden lights… they showed me where you are. Can you meet us at Griffith Observatory?”

“They showed you? Like a vision?”

“It’s hard to explain. But I think we’re not the only survivors. And I think someone — or *something* — is trying to
help.”

Daryl looked up. The golden lights shimmered in the brightening sky, drifting in deliberate, graceful patterns.

“Navigation,” he muttered.

“Exactly. Officer, we don’t have much time. Whatever’s inside these people — it’s organizing.  
And the lights... I think they’re trying to stop it.”

He started the engine. “I’m on my way.”

As he drove through the city, he saw them everywhere. People wandering in a daze — no more flickering eyes, but no
clarity either. Like they were stuck between nightmares and memory.

The radio crackled again.

**“Daryl? This is Father Martinez. I’m heading to the observatory too. Sarah explained… well, as best she could.”**

Another voice joined in.

**“This is Miriam Košová, from Brno. The children are safe. But I think I need to come.”**

Then a younger, sharper voice.

**“And I’m Aida. I’ve got data. A lot of data. And I think I know what those parasites are trying to do.”**

Daryl shook his head. Six hours ago, he’d been a beat cop.

Now? Part of a global resistance against an alien threat.

“So,” he said into the radio, “we’re all meeting up to save the world?”

**“Something like that,”** Sarah replied.  
**“But first, we need to understand who we’re really dealing with — the bad ones... and the good ones.”**

He turned onto the road leading up to the observatory.

Multiple vehicles were already parked. People were stepping out — exhausted, wary, but alert.

Above them hovered one of the golden lights. Larger than the rest. Brighter.

As Daryl stepped out of his car, he heard a voice in his mind.  
Not invasive like the parasites’.  
Gentle.  
Welcoming.

**“Welcome, warrior. We’ve been waiting for you.”**

He looked up. “Who are you?”

**“We are those who arrive when worlds are in danger. And your world... is in grave danger.”**

Sarah Chen approached him. “They speak telepathically. But not like the others. Not like the parasites.  
They don’t force themselves in. They ask permission.”

“Permission for what?”

**“To show you the truth. To explain who attacked you — and why we were too late.”**

The golden light pulsed — and suddenly, Daryl saw.

Visions flooded his mind: alien worlds, species he couldn’t name, and the same pattern repeated over and over —  
parasitic invasions, followed by attempted rescues. But not always in time.

**“The Vak’tar are criminals,”** the voice said. **“Outcasts from our galactic order. We’ve hunted them for centuries.
But they’ve become clever.”**

“And you?” asked Aida, clutching her laptop.

**“We are the Anari. And we owe your species an apology… and restitution.”**

Father Martinez stepped forward. “Restitution for what?”

**“For not stopping them in time. For letting so many suffer. And…”**

The light dimmed.

**“…for the fact that this was only the beginning.”**

Silence fell.

“The beginning?” Miriam whispered.

**“The Vak’tar you encountered were just scouts. The main force is still coming.”**

Daryl looked around at the others — survivors, allies, strangers now bound by fire. He saw fear. Fatigue. But also
resolve.

“How much time do we have?” asked Sarah.

**“Two days. Maybe three.”**

“And what can we possibly do against an alien army in two days?”

The golden light surged.

**“With our help? Everything.”**
