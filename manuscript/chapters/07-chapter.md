Sarah Chen returned to Earth as the leader of the first interplanetary alliance in human history.

Behind her were not five lightships, but eight. The three liberated Vak'tar ships had transformed - their dark
their dark, organic hulls now glowed with the same golden light as the Anari technology. But they
looked different. No longer like insects or predators, but like... Flowers. Complex, crystalline structures that
spun in the sunlight like living jewels.

**You are beautiful**, Miriam glowed in awe.

**You are free**, corrected a new voice - not human, but warm and melodic. **For the first time in millennia
millennia we are free.

The voice belonged to Zephyr, the spokesman for the liberated ships. Sarah had learned that "he" had once been a being called
Kythran - a poet-philosopher from a world with three suns. Two hundred years ago, the Vak'tar had conquered his
conquered his homeland, assimilated his body, enslaved his mind. Now he was himself again, freed from the
from the parasites that had controlled him.

**It's strange**, Zephyr continued, **to feel again after so long. Hope. Gratitude. And... something
you humans call "homesickness."

**For your original world?** Father Martinez asked sympathetically.

**No. For the world down there. Your blue planet is so... alive. So full of possibilities. We want to help protect it.
protect it.

Sarah looked down at the earth. It looked peaceful from up here - white clouds over green and brown land masses,
blue oceans glistening in the sunlight. But she knew that down below, billions of people were waiting for the news
waiting for the news she would bring.

**Time for the most difficult mission of all**, she glowed. **We have to explain to humanity that we are not
no longer... well, just human**.

**And that we have alien allies**, Daryl added. **This is going to be interesting**.

Aida had been working with her Quantum interface the whole time. **I have all the important governments,
military staffs and intelligence organizations in the world in one network**, she reported. **They can all hear us
at the same time**.

**Ready for the first press conference in space?** Sarah asked with a wry smile.

It opened a communication channel that reached every functioning television, computer and smartphone on earth.
reached.

"People of Earth," she began, her voice translated into dozens of languages, "this is Dr. Sarah Chen.
Eight hours ago, we were five survivors of an alien invasion. Now we are the ambassadors of a new hope."

Pause. She could imagine the confusion and fear that prevailed on Earth.

"The beings who attacked us - the Vak'tar - are parasites. Criminals who were cast out by their own species.
by their own species. They're not just taking over humans. They have enslaved millions of species across the galaxy.
But today we have discovered that they are vulnerable. And that we can stop them."

She activated the visual sensors, transmitting images of the eight ships in their formation.

"The three new ships you see were enemies just a few hours ago. Now they are allies. We have removed the
parasites and freed the original inhabitants. Beings from other worlds who were victims just like us."

A new voice intervened - Zephyr, whose words were translated into melodic harmonies:

"People of Earth, I speak to you as one who has been enslaved for two hundred years. Your species has something
unique - the ability to free others instead of destroying them. You have not only given me back my life
but my will, my soul. For that, we are in your debt."

Sarah waited a moment, letting it sink in. Then came the difficult part:

"In fourteen hours, the Vak'tar main fleet will arrive. Two thousand ships. But we no longer believe that this
is an invasion. We believe it's an opportunity - the greatest liberation operation in the history of the galaxy.
galaxy."

**Reactions from Earth are coming in**, Aida reported. **And they are... mixed**.

Sarah opened an audio channel to the most important world leaders.

"Dr. Chen," came the voice of the US President, "do I understand correctly? You're suggesting that we don't fight,
but... negotiate?"

"Don't negotiate, Mr. President. Free them. The Vak'tar ships are full of prisoners - assimilated beings from
hundreds of worlds. If we can free them, we'll suddenly have an alliance of thousands of species."

The British Prime Minister spoke up: "That's a huge risk, Dr. Chen. What if you're wrong?
What if it's a trick?"

Father Martinez replied: "Then we die as what we have chosen to be. As liberators, not conquerors."

A new voice - the Secretary-General of the UN: "Dr. Chen, you mention that you and your team... have been changed.
Can you explain that?"

Sarah took a deep breath. "We were improved by the Anari - the original beings of light. Physically and mentally.
We are still human, but we are also more. We can do things that normal humans can't."

"How what?" asked the French president suspiciously.

Daryl replied: "I can pilot a spaceship with my mind and fire a gun from here in Los Angeles without hurting anyone.
from here without hurting anyone."

Aida added: "I can control every computer system on Earth at the same time."

Miriam added: "I can feel and influence the emotions of millions of people."

Father Martinez: "I can bring back the dead if death is not yet final."

Sarah concluded: "And I can remove parasitic invaders from any living creature without killing the host."

Silence. Then the voice of the Chinese Prime Minister: "You are describing gods, not people."

"No," Sarah contradicted gently. "We're describing people who had the choice between death and evolution. And who
have chosen evolution."

**New data**, Aida suddenly reported. **The Vak'tar fleet has accelerated again. Arrival in eleven hours, fourteen
minutes**.

Sarah relayed this information immediately. "We have less time than we thought. I need a decision from the
Earth's governments. Do you trust us? Will you let us try to liberate a galaxy?"

Long silence. Then the voice of a surprising person - a child whose signal had somehow hacked into the transmission
had hacked into the transmission:

"Why shouldn't we trust you? You've already saved us once."

More voices came forward. Not from governments, but from ordinary people:

"It does."

"You are our hope."

"Free them all."

The wave of support was overwhelming.

**The decision has been made**, Sarah beamed at her team. **Humanity is behind us**.

"Dr. Chen," the UN Secretary-General spoke up again, "what do you need from us?"

"Preparation. If this works, we'll have millions of liberated aliens who need medical help, food and temporary shelter.
and temporary shelter. Open all military bases, all airports, all large buildings. Get Earth ready,
refugees from all over the galaxy."

**Crazy**, Daryl lit up. **A week ago I was a cop chasing traffic offenders. Now I'm organizing
galactic refugee aid.

**This is evolution**, Zephyr replied philosophically. **Not just physically, but morally. You humans are evolving
from a planetary to a cosmic species**.

Sarah looked over at the other freed ships. **Can you contact others? Other assimilated ships in
in the fleet?**

**We're trying**, replied another speaker - Lyralei, once a sea creature from a water world. **But
the Vak'tar have learned. They block our communication. They know we are free.

**Then they will be prepared**, Father Martinez stated.

**Good**, Sarah said with a smile in her voice. **Then we can show them what humans are capable of when they're prepared.
prepared**.

She turned to Earth: "People of Earth, in eleven hours the battle for the soul of the galaxy will begin. Not only
for our survival, but for the liberation of millions of enslaved souls. We are no longer just humans. We are
are bearers of hope."

Break.

"Get yourselves ready. We're bringing guests home."

## Los Angeles, Griffith Observatory

## 2:45 pm local time

An hour later, the eight ships landed again in the observatory parking lot. But this time they were not
alone.

Hundreds of people had gathered. Not just curious people, but volunteers. Doctors, nurses,
engineers, teachers, cooks - people who were ready to help.

As Sarah stepped off her boat, she saw something that made her heart sing: Mrs. Patterson, her old neighbor,
stood in the crowd. Alive, unharmed, and holding a sign: "Welcome home, Dr. Chen."

"Mrs. Patterson!" Sarah ran to her and hugged her.

"I knew you were special, dear," the older woman said with tears in her eyes. "But this...
this is wonderful."

Zephyr and the other freed beings materialized next to their ships. They looked like beings of light, but
with differences - Zephyr had a slender, elegant form, Lyralei flowing, undulating movements.

The people in the crowd stared, but not with fear. With awe. With welcome.

A little girl - maybe six years old - ran up to Zephyr and handed him a bouquet of flowers.

"Thank you for helping us," she said.

Zephyr knelt down and took the flowers. "No, little earth dweller. Thank you for showing us
what freedom means."

Sarah looked around her - at her transformed companions, at the freed aliens, at the humans who had come to help.
had come to help. At her home, which was preparing to become a refuge for an entire galaxy.

**Eleven hours**, Aida glowed softly.

**Eleven hours**, Sarah confirmed. **Then we change the universe**.

She looked up at the stars, where the largest fleet in the history of the galaxy was racing towards her.

**Come on**, she thought. **We're ready**.

For the first time in human history, Earth was not alone in the universe.

And she would never be alone again.
