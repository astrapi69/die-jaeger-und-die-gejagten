**Draven Quantum** writes stories at the intersection of technological wonder and human depth.  
With a background in cognitive science and a passion for extraterrestrial intelligence, he envisions futures that both
unsettle and inspire hope.

After his acclaimed debut _Shadows over New Eden_, he now turns in _The Hunters and the Hunted_ to a silent invasion
that challenges our ideas of progress, freedom, and compassion.
