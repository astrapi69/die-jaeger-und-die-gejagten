## 📖 Project Description

This project delves into the human psyche through the lens of pursuit — both literal and metaphorical.  
It examines how moral lines blur when survival, ideology, and guilt intertwine.  
Combining narrative intensity with philosophical undertones, it continues the author’s exploration of consciousness,
morality, and identity.
