  What happens when tiny parasitic aliens take over humanity – and cosmic enforcers arrive to stop them?

  The Vak'tar are microscopic sadists, entering sleeping humans through the nose and ears at night. They turn their hosts into monstrous versions of themselves, attacking loved ones and plunging the world into chaos. But the Vak'tar are not invincible. They are criminals – outcasts of their own species.

  Then the Anari arrive: beings of light, cosmic hunters who pursue these parasitic criminals across the galaxy. They liberate humanity, but the damage is already done. As restitution, the Anari do more than heal the trauma — they offer wisdom and technology that could transform humanity into something greater than it has ever been.

  A story of resistance, healing, and the question: What makes us human when everything seems lost?

  Follow neurologist Dr. Sarah Chen, hacker Aida Ramić, veteran Daryl Mensah, and others who were strong enough to resist the parasites — and now stand watch over the fragile peace of a new world.
