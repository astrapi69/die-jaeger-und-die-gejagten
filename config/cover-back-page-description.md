**They came in our sleep. And changed everything.**  
-----------------------------------------------

Tiny like insects, unstoppable like an idea,  
the alien visitors infiltrated humanity—silent and precise.  
What began as an invasion became a quiet revolution.

People awoke transformed: healthy, peaceful, clear.  
No more violence. No more disease. No more hate.  
But the price was invisible—  
freedom, emotion, self-determination.

Only a few felt that something was missing.  
A trace of resistance. A flicker of memory.  
When the truth is revealed, humanity faces its greatest choice:  
**Safety or freedom? Control or compassion?**

A gripping sci-fi novel about trust, hope,  
and what it truly means to be human.
