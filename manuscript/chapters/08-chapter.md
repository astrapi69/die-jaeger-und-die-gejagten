## Griffith Observatory, Los Angeles

## 11:58 p.m. local time

In just two minutes, the Vak'tar main fleet would reach the solar system.

Sarah Chen stood on the observatory roof, gazing up at the stars. Around her, Earth had transformed into something she’d
never imagined possible: a galactic welcome palace.

Across the planet, runways glowed. Hospitals had opened their doors. Schools had become shelters. In New York, London,
Tokyo, Sydney—in every major city—people waited with blankets, food, and medical supplies.

"Ready?" asked Daryl, standing beside her. His adaptive armor shimmered in the moonlight like liquid silver.

"No one can truly be ready for what we’re about to do," Sarah replied. "But we’re as ready as humans can be."

Father Martinez knelt in silent meditation, his healing staff glowing gently. Aida was plugged into her quantum
interface, monitoring every communication channel in the system. Miriam stood near the three liberated alien ships,
whispering with Zephyr and the others.

**They’re coming**, Aida suddenly lit up.

Sarah sensed it before she saw it—a wave of cold rolling through space. Two hours earlier than predicted.

They emerged in the sky like a swarm of black stars. Not two thousand ships—Sarah counted quickly—over three thousand.
The Vak'tar had brought reinforcements.

**My God**, Daryl glowed. **That’s more than we expected.**

**Far more**, Zephyr added with quiet urgency. **They’ve mobilized their entire sector fleet.**

Sarah extended her awareness, scanning the incoming armada. Each ship teemed with life—but not Vak'tar life. Prisoners.
Millions upon millions of assimilated beings from hundreds of worlds.

**These aren’t warships**, she realized. **They’re prisoner transports.**

**What do you mean?** asked Father Martinez.

Sarah understood. **They’re not here to conquer Earth. They’re bringing all their prisoners. Every being they’ve ever
assimilated. This isn’t just an invasion—it’s their entire... civilization.**

**Why would they do that?** Miriam asked.

Zephyr’s voice carried solemn clarity: **Because they know they’ve been exposed. Because they know the Anari finally
found a way to stop them. This is their last stand. All or nothing.**

Sarah felt the weight of it. **If we fail, we don’t just lose Earth—we lose every chance to free those millions.**

**And if we win?** Daryl asked.

**Then we free an entire galaxy,** said Father Martinez.

The ships drew closer. Sarah could see their grotesque details—each one cobbled together from the technologies and
bodies of the species they had conquered. A museum of cosmic cruelty.

**Incoming transmission,** Aida reported. **The command ships are broadcasting.**

**Open the channel,** Sarah ordered.

A voice filled her mind—cold, layered, as if millions spoke in unison:

*Light-beings of Earth. We are the Vak'tar Dominance. You have corrupted our scouts. Freed our prisoners. That was a
mistake.*

Sarah spoke aloud, her voice broadcasting across every channel on Earth:

"We are humans. And we are here to free everyone you've enslaved."

*Humans.* The word echoed like a curse. *A primitive species from a meaningless world. You don’t understand what you’ve
done. These beings were weak. We made them strong.*

"You made them slaves."

*We improved them. Just as the Anari improved you. The only difference is—we’re honest about the cost.*

Sarah wavered. Was that true? Were they really so different from the Vak'tar?

Then Father Martinez spoke—calm, unwavering: "The difference is choice. We chose. Your prisoners never did."

*Choice is an illusion,* the Vak'tar sneered. *Survival is all that matters. And we will survive.*

**They’re attacking!** Aida warned.

The three thousand ships surged with terrifying speed. But not toward Earth—they spread into a perfect sphere,
surrounding the solar system.

**They’re encircling us,** Daryl realized.

Sarah understood instantly. **They want to ensure no one escapes—not us, not their prisoners.**

Zephyr glowed with urgency: **It’s a trap. If they can’t win, they’ll destroy everything.**

**How much time do we have?** asked Sarah.

**Twelve minutes until attack formation,** Aida calculated.

Sarah turned to her team. Five humans and three freed aliens—against three thousand ships and millions of parasites.

Impossible odds. But impossible odds were a hallmark of humanity.

"Time for Plan B," she said.

**What’s Plan B?** Daryl asked.

Sarah smiled—her smile glowing with golden light. "We do what humans do best. We improvise."

She opened her mind and reached out—not just to Earth, but to every consciousness aboard the Vak'tar ships:

"People of Earth. Assimilated beings of the galaxy. My name is Sarah Chen, and I speak to you in the darkest hour our
universe has ever known."

Her voice reached every receiver on Earth and slipped into the communications systems of the Vak'tar fleet.

"The parasites told you resistance is futile. That you are weak. That you must be improved. But they lied."

Sarah sensed something stir inside the ships. Millions of suppressed minds heard a new voice—perhaps for the first time
in centuries.

"You are not weak. You are not broken. You are imprisoned. But prison is not forever. Slavery is not your truth."

**Sarah, what are you doing?** Miriam asked.

**Something crazy,** Sarah replied. **I’m speaking directly to every prisoner.**

"I know you can hear me. Beneath the parasites’ voices, beneath the pain—your true self still remains. And now it’s time
to awaken."

Suddenly, a ship flickered—a massive, crystalline dreadnought. Its black hull pulsed with faint light.

**One ship is reacting,** Aida said in awe.

Then a second. Then a third.

**That’s impossible,** Zephyr protested. **They shouldn’t be able to reach so many ships from here.**

But Sarah knew: **We don’t need to reach them all. We only need to free the first. The rest will follow.**

She focused everything on the flickering ship: **You are free. Wake up. Remember who you are.**

The ship exploded with light—not in destruction, but transformation. Its dark skin peeled away like a shed snakeskin,
revealing a vessel of living crystal, radiant in every color of the spectrum.

From it, a wave of liberation spread.

**It’s working!** Father Martinez cried. **They’re freeing themselves!**

But the Vak'tar commanders responded immediately. Controlled ships opened fire—not on Earth, but on their freed
brethren.

**They’re attacking their own,** Daryl gasped.

**They’d rather destroy everything than lose control,** Miriam said grimly.

Beams of black energy lanced through space. Freed ships glowed—and were extinguished. The battle for each soul had
begun.

Sarah saw the chaos—and made her choice.

"Aida, link me to every device on Earth. Daryl, Miriam, Father Martinez—give me your strength. Zephyr, amplify the
signal."

**What are you planning?** Daryl asked.

"Something no one's ever done. I’ll try to free them all—at once."

**That could kill you,** Zephyr warned.

Sarah looked skyward, at the millions still enslaved.

"Then I die as a human," she said softly.

She opened herself completely. Every wall, every barrier dissolved. Her power—amplified by her companions—blazed forth
like a supernova of pure will.

**I AM SARAH CHEN**, she radiated, **I AM A HUMAN BEING OF EARTH. AND I SAY: YOU. ARE. FREE.**

The message exploded through the system. Every Vak'tar ship trembled. Millions of minds heard—and awakened.

Time stood still.

And then—the greatest lightshow in galactic history began.

Ship by ship, fleet by fleet, the prisoners broke free. Black hulls fell away. Crystal vessels emerged—each unique, each
a masterpiece of its reborn species.

But the cost was high. Sarah collapsed to her knees, consciousness fading.

**Sarah!** Miriam rushed to her.

"Is it... is it over?" Sarah whispered.

Daryl looked skyward. What had once been an enemy fleet now shimmered in a rainbow of shapes and colors. A fleet of the
freed.

"It’s over," he said quietly. "We won."

But as he looked again, his blood turned to ice.

Not all the ships were glowing.

At the center of the fleet, surrounded by a dozen black dreadnoughts, hovered something new—something larger than all
others.

The Vak'tar mothership.

And it was headed straight for Earth.

"Sarah," Daryl said hoarsely. "We’re not done yet."
