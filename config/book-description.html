<h1>The Hunters and the Hunted</h1>
<h2>Book 1 of The Guardian Chronicles – Epic Sci-Fi Series</h2>

<p><strong>Book 1 of the epic sci-fi series <em>The Guardian Chronicles</em> – gripping, philosophical, and full of
    hope.</strong></p>

<p><em>On the night of October 15th, the world changes forever.</em></p>

<p>Invisible parasitic alien entities – the Vak'tar – infiltrate human minds. They control thoughts, amplify evil, and
    turn humanity into their own weapon.</p>

<p>Dr. Sarah Chen, a neurologist, is one of the first to realize: this is not a disease – it's an invasion.</p>

<p>But the real battle only begins when a second alien race appears: the Anari – hunters of the Vak'tar. They don’t
    fight with weapons but with light, insight, and consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>What if the evil within us is only amplified – and the good just as much?</strong></p>

<p>Amid global collapse, a small group of resisters forms: a teacher, a priest, a veteran, a hacker – and Sarah.</p>

<p>They all still carry hope. And they might be the first to become guardians of a new Earth.</p>

<p>A novel about darkness and light, guilt and redemption, technology and consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>For readers of <em>The Expanse</em>, <em>Arrival</em>, and <em>Children of Time</em> – yet with its own
    distinctive voice.</strong></p>
